# React Redux

- user cannot access the page / data unless login
- parse the json file and output for each message component
- graph page: is a d3 graph (directed force graph).

Note: I was unable to run emails.json, because the file is wayy too big and my computer cannot render it.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy configuration and replace with your own
cp src/utils/config.example.js src/utils/config.js

# Run
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.
